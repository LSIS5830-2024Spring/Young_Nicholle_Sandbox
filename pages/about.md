## About the Collection

This site features pictures of when I did a solo trip to Naples, Italy.
This was my first overseas trip ever.

I was very excited to go during 2019.
I had preplanned to visit places I always dreamed of visiting!

I also visited Rome, Italy during this trip.

Someday I'd like to return and visit other sites in Naples, Italy.
